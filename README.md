# Stock Index Prediction Using Machine Learning
Our goal is predicting the future performance of a stock index (we chose VFV.TO - Vanguard S&P 500 Index ETF), using price data from 2019 to Present Day. The project involves data collection & preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation based on real-world financial data.

We aim to use machine learning techniques to predict price movements for this index. Specifically, we will 3 train models (1 each) using data from 2019 to 2025 and generate predictions for January-December 2025, which we will validate using January-March 2025 data. Additionally, we aim to forecast the future direction of the index (until the end of the year).
